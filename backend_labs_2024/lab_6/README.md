### How to Start

To start the server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
    ```
   node app.js
   ```

   This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the files.

4. Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:4000 .
