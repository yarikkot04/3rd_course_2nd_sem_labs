### How to Start

To start the server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
    ```
   node index.js
   ```

   This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the files.
